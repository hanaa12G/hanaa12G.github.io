## Hello, today I start to write blog
Today I start setting a blog page again, though I have tried it a few times in
the past and never completed it. Compare to them, this time:
### Now I try to be as much lazy as possible, but my habit still remains sometimes

  My brain tend to run away when complexity increases. Everytimes I step out of
  my comfort zone, it takes me a lot of time to read and understanding the
  problem and try my best of giving the best solution. It takes me weeks to
  do something that I need to do and few weeks later I think it wasn't good
  enough. Then I try to redo it, which then make me stuck in a complete loop of
  fixing simple problem.


  An example for this is when I choose how to do hosting this static blog. I
  tried to look at many different options and then decided to do it from
  scratch, and then give up months later as I don't want to spend money to run
  the code. Somewhere between that I would try to write HTTP parsers, follow RFC
  to try implementing SSL and so on. None of that reaches completion.
  The more time I re-do something, I find that the more lazy I get, this time I
  finally say to myself that I'm not that smart and go directly to the food on
  the table. Although, I take half a day to choose the technology haha.
### The help of AI, this help me speed things up tremendously

I think this year AI helps me alot when learn anything news. As you can see I
can style this blog very quickly in a span of 1 hour. If it was me try to do the
same thing, I would take like 1 day. Doing this this fast keeps me exite enough
and it motivates me to do more, and I have more time to do something else.

Only in my comfort zone I tend to do things myself without AI involvement. I
know where to look at document, I know where to search for issue and solution, I
know who to ask. In this space I barely touch AI except trivial things like
choose a good name for a function or classes.

### Self reflect

And the start of the year I looks back at what I've done last year and see what
I can do this year. The time for me is running out. I'm 26 already I got no
success in life or anything. This time this anger me enough to move my ass
around, instead of blaming on things 

The more I catch up with my friends and my colleagues, they have plans and look
like they're trying so much. I lost my goal some time ago but maybe this year.
Yeah I'll try to live my best life (Hope I won't throw this under the table
again)
